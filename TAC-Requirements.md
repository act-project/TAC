# Requirements to join ACT
The following document outlines requirements for projects interested in joining the Automating Compliance Tooling Project umbrella. All ACT umbrella projects are required to participate in bi-monthly Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) calls. ACT projects and affiliate projects maintain one vote in all TAC voting body decisions.

## General Criteria for non-affiliate projects to join the ACT umbrella
* Willingness to generate/consume/interoperate with [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/).
* Formal project technical charter in place approved by the Linux Foundation. 
* The software for the project must be licensed under an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
* Project must be 100% open source (i.e. not a vendor onramp tool).
* Must be usable without a commercial component or without a downgraded user experience if not using proprietary software (i.e. proprietary database tie-ins).
* Data source neutrality must be possible (i.e. tool must not be tied to one particular vendor and must be able to access other data sources).
* Proprietary plugins are OK but must not be the only mode of operation.
* Active development and participation.

## Criteria to become an Incubating Project
* Support for SPDX.
    * If SBOM producing tool, assumption is that tool produces valid SPDX documents
    * If consumption tool, assumption is that tool is able to consume valid SPDX documents
* Formal project technical charter in place approved by the Linux Foundation. 
* "Proof of concept" tools  are ok i.e. not fully functional tools that might aim to solve a larger ecosystem problem.
* The software for the project must be licensed under an OSI approved license.
* Data source neutrality must be possible.
* Source code must be publicly available.
* How to contribute to the project is documented.
* Prior to being an incubation project, a presentation will be made to TAC members discussing the general usefulness of the tool and demonstrating how it works as well as any other relevant information (project roadmap, etc).
* One ACT TAC project member must be willing to “sponsor” and act as a liason on behalf of the incubating project.
* Active development and participation.
* Note: Incubating projects do not receive an ACT TAC vote until they have graduated to a regular project status.

## Criteria to become an Affiliate Project
* Support for SPDX.
    * If SBOM producing tool, assumption is that tool produces valid SPDX documents
    * If consumption tool, assumption is that tool is able to consume valid SPDX documents
* Data source neutrality must be possible.
* Project/tool is established and fully functional (not proof of concepts).
* The software for the project must be licensed under an OSI approved license.
* Presentation to TAC members showing how the tool works amd its overall usefulness/completeness.
* At least one ACT project member endorsement, and willing to “sponsor”.
* TAC members may not sponsor a project for which they have a clear conflict of interest (for example, originating primarily from their organization). This doesn’t mean that they can’t have any involvement at all - for example, contributing pull requests, or being an end user of that project, can signal a healthy interest in and knowledge of a worthwhile project.
* TAC vote to accept through a two-thirds vote of the TAC and raised by liaison.
* Project has a code of conduct and has demonstrated it is a welcoming environment.
* Active development and participation.

## Criteria to Graduate from Incubating to TAC Project/TAC voting member
* Project has been in incubating stage at least 6 months
* Incubating project maintainers will participate in a TAC meeting for discussion and Q&A. Any resulting action items are addressed.
* The project has multiple participants and code development beyond original contribution.
* Formal governance in place meeting Linux Foundation governance requirements.
* TAC vote to accept out of incubating status through a two-thirds vote of the TAC.
* Sponsor has verified that the project has sufficiently demonstrated the project to be usable and substantial.
* The project demonstrates CII best practices (vulnerability handling, etc.) and maintains a passing criteria.
* Project has a code of conduct and has demonstrated it is a welcoming environment for contributors.

# Revocation Policy
* When any of the general criteria no longer applies, the project will be given a warning. After a 6 month warning of inaction on behalf of the project, the TAC will hold a vote (requiring two thirds consensus) to remove the project from its current status and revoke TAC voting privileges.
